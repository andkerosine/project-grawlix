// ALDOUS-BRODER

// between them if the destination has not yet been visited. Continue until all
// cells have been visited, resulting in a perfectly uniform spanning tree with
// no biases. Given the undirected approach to finding the next edge to remove,
// this algorithm is only guaranteed to complete given infinite time, but it is
// sufficient for mazes of moderate size.
